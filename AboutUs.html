In addition to playing basketball and running cross-country and track at Lakeside, Rozi participates in her school community as the president of Black Student Union and a member of the Student Affinity Leadership Team, and as a Senior Leader. Rozi first started to see the unfortunate reality of police brutality after the deaths of Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, and Michael Brown in 2014. As the years have gone by and hundreds of police brutality cases have resulted in acquitted officers, Rozi realizes that educating those around her is now more important than ever. Many feel removed from this situation, but Rozi believes it is important to realize that this could happen to anyone.</p>

As a young, African-American girl, she sees what goes on in the news regarding inequality for people of color, and despite her age, she does what she can to make an impact. Having the opportunity to be apart of T.A.P. In America is only the beginning of a bigger movement for Khloe's involvement in the community. No matter the age, Khloe believes that everyone, of all races and genders, young or old, can be involved for the greater good of the world </p>
