  <h4>Rozi H</h4>
	
  <hr>
  <p>Rozi is a senior at Lakeside School in Seattle, WA. In addition to playing basketball and running cross-country and track at Lakeside, Rozi participates in her school community as the president of Black Student Union and a member of the Student Affinity Leadership Team, and as a Senior Leader. Rozi first started to see the unfortunate reality of police brutality after the deaths of Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, and Michael Brown in 2014. As the years have gone by and hundreds of police brutality cases have resulted in acquitted officers, Rozi realizes that educating those around her is now more important than ever. Many feel removed from this situation, but Rozi believes it is important to realize that this could happen to anyone. </p>

Mikayla is passionate about spreading the word about Police Brutality because she doesn't think that teens her age realize how much of an issue it is. Every minority life is precious, but at the same time it could be taken at any moment.This is something that many teens fail to realize. Stay woke. </p>
